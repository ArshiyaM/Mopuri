/**
 * Purpose of Variables
 * ---------------------
 * Variables are used to store the values by using these values we are achieving the project requirements.
 * 
 * Ex: Employee Project contains variables as mentioned below
 * int empId=111;
 * String emPname = "MRT";
 * 
 * Types of Variables
 * ------------------
 * ------------------
 * 1. Local Variables:
 * 
 * i. Variables which are declared inside a method/inside constructor/ inside a blocks(static or instance) are called "Local Variables".
 *    EX: LocalVariable1
 * ii. Scope: Scope of the Local Variable is only within the method/within constructor/ within a blocks(static or instance).
 * iii. Memory Allocation: Local Variables memory allocated when the method is invoked. And also memory is released when the method execution is completed.
 * 
 * 
 * int a=10; --> Here 'a' is variable of type 'int'
 * Variable Types: 
 * 
 * Every variable must be contains with its own type. They are:
 * a. Primitive type ==> Ex- int a=10; float f=10.5f;
 * b. class-type     ==> Ex - Test t; Employee emp;
 * c. Array-type     ==> Ex - int[] a; Staring[] str;
 *  
 * 
 * 
 * 2. Instance Variables
 * 3. Static Variables
