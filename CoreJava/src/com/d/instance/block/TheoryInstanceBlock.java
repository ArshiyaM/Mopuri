 * Instance Blocks
 * ---------------
 * 1. Instance blocks are used to write the logics, those logics are executed during the object creation.
 * 
 * Important Point:
 * ----------------
 * During the object creation say if the constructor and instance blocks are present, first instance blocks will execute then the constructor will execute.
 * 
 * 
 * Difference between constructor and Instance Blocks?
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * 1. Constructor logics are specific to object where as Instance Blocks are common for all logics.
 * 2. Say if there are 10 objects created --->> For every object different constructor logics are executed where as for 10-objects one instance block is executed.
 * 
 * To understand go through the "Instance2.java"
 * 
 * What is the need of Instance Blocks on Java?
 * 
 * Answer:
